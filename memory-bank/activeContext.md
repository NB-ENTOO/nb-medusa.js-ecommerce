# Active Development Context - Enterprise Equipment Configuration Platform

## Environment Status
- **Local Platform**: Windows 10 (where Cursor AI is running)
- **Remote Platform**: Proxmox LXC running Ubuntu (where project files are hosted)
- **Containerization**: Docker installed on the remote Ubuntu system
- **Connection**: SSH from Windows to the remote Ubuntu host
- **Project Path**: `/home/admin/docker/medusa`
- **Git**: Installed (version 2.43.0)
- **Node.js**: Status to be determined
- **PostgreSQL**: Status to be determined
- **Redis**: Status to be determined
- **Medusa CLI**: Not yet installed
- **PDF Generation**: Not yet configured
- **Email Service**: Not yet configured
- **B2B Starter Reference**: Located in `/medusa/reference files/b2b-starter-medusa-main reference/`

## Current Focus
Setting up the initial enterprise equipment configuration platform with proper memory bank structure and cursor rules alignment. The platform will combine:
- ETB Technologies functionality for enterprise equipment configuration
- Medusa B2B Starter UI patterns and components

## Recent Changes
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Established basic documentation for project context
- Added deployment environment information
- Updated cursor rules to reflect dual OS environment
- Verified Git installation (version 2.43.0)
- Updated project requirements to focus on enterprise equipment configuration
- Removed traditional e-commerce features (cart, checkout)
- Added quotation generation and email delivery requirements
- Analyzed B2B Starter UI components and patterns
- Mapped ETB Technologies functionality to B2B Starter UI structure

## Current Phase
**Foundation** - Initial setup and project structuring

## Active Development Areas
- Project structure setup
- Environment preparation
- Documentation establishment
- Core configuration files
- Component management system design
