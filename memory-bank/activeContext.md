# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Setting up Docker Compose development environment
- Configuring services for local development
- Ensuring proper service communication
- Setting up persistent storage

## Recent Changes
- Added Docker Compose configuration to technical context
- Updated system patterns with Docker Compose patterns
- Defined service architecture for local development

## Active Development Areas
1. Docker Compose Configuration
   - Service definitions
   - Network setup
   - Volume management
   - Environment variables

2. Service Integration
   - Backend API service
   - Database service
   - Redis cache
   - Frontend services

## Next Steps
1. Create Docker Compose configuration
2. Set up service Dockerfiles
3. Configure environment variables
4. Test service communication
5. Implement development workflow

## Integration Points
- B2B Starter UI components will be adapted for Docker environment
- Service communication will use Docker network
- Data persistence will use Docker volumes
- Environment variables will be managed through Docker Compose

## Current Phase
- Foundation: Docker Compose Setup

## Notes
- All services will run in Docker containers
- Development environment will be consistent across team members
- Local development will mirror production architecture
- Services will be isolated but interconnected
